#  BUFUS

This tool is for linux users who want to flash their ISO into their flash drive easily


im a beginner in C so i got an idea to make this tool for linux users:)

for running it you need to type
```
gcc bufus.c 
OR 
gcc bufus.c -o bufus

./bufus
if you dont use -o you need to type
./a.out

```
